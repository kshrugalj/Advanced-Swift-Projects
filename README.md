# Advanced Swift Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of advanced Swift projects that I have developed using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**. Each project demonstrates various concepts, ranging from game development to real-time data fetching with APIs and practical utilities. These projects serve as excellent examples of Swift and SwiftUI capabilities.

## Projects 📱

### 1. **BouncyBall 🏀**
A dynamic and fun game where a ball bounces inside a container. This project showcases basic animations, physics, and SwiftUI layout principles.

### 2. **Connect4 🔴🟡**
A classic two-player Connect 4 game built with SwiftUI. Players take turns dropping discs into a grid, aiming to connect four discs in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

### 3. **CryptoTracker 💰**
A cryptocurrency tracker that fetches live data from the **CoinGecko API**. Users can view the latest cryptocurrency prices, trends, and details for multiple coins in real-time.

### 4. **Element Quiz 🧪**
An interactive quiz app focused on testing users’ knowledge of the periodic table. Users answer multiple-choice questions about chemical elements and get instant feedback on their selections.

### 5. **iCalories 🍏**
A calorie tracking app that helps users monitor their daily nutritional intake. Users can log meals and track calories with a simple, easy-to-use interface.

### 6. **PhotoFrame 🖼️**
A digital photo frame that allows users to display their favorite photos in a slideshow. The app includes customizable transition effects for an elegant viewing experience.

### 7. **QuestionBot 🤖**
An AI-powered chatbot that answers various questions from users. It uses machine learning to understand and provide accurate responses to a wide range of inquiries.

### 8. **Quiz Game 🎮**
An engaging trivia quiz app that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions. The app tracks the score and provides feedback on correct/incorrect answers in real-time.

### 9. **TicTacToe ✖️⭕**
A simple Tic Tac Toe game for two players, where they take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The app determines the winner or a tie based on the game rules.
